To begin, this is a simpler version of the poker game. The cards are permanent, meaning that whenever one is drawn there is still the same amount of cards in the list.
I am not perfect so I doubt this is a 100% complete but I've just spent so much time on it and testing it, and haven't found a permutation where it bugs out.
ace_check ensures that if there are aces and its over 21, then it turns them to 1.
and winner_winner pretty much calls the shots, along with giving the computer time to draw cards if its on a low score.
